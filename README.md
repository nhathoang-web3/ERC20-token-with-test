# Sample ERC20 With Test Scripts Project

This project demonstrates a basic ERC20 token standard. It comes with a ERC20 token contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Deployed sample: https://goerli.etherscan.io/token/0xf055bb6a78c9ef26ca9b78b945437edfe22cddf1

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```

The above sample is just a basic token, if you have more requirements needs to do, you can hire us to develop your smart contract.
